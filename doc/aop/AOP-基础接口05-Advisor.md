这一篇看下Advisor这个接口及其子接口。  

###Advisor接口
```java
/**
 * Base interface holding AOP <b>advice</b> (action to take at a joinpoint)
 * and a filter determining the applicability of the advice (such as
 * a pointcut). <i>This interface is not for use by Spring users, but to
 * allow for commonality in support for different types of advice.</i>
 *
 * <p>Spring AOP is based around <b>around advice</b> delivered via method
 * <b>interception</b>, compliant with the AOP Alliance interception API.
 * The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice,
 * such as <b>before</b> and <b>after</b> advice, which need not be
 * implemented using interception.
 *
 */
public interface Advisor {

	/**
	 * Return the advice part of this aspect. An advice may be an
	 * interceptor, a before advice, a throws advice, etc.
	 * @return the advice that should apply if the pointcut matches
	 */
	Advice getAdvice();

	/**
	 * Return whether this advice is associated with a particular instance
	 * (for example, creating a mixin) or shared with all instances of
	 * the advised class obtained from the same Spring bean factory.
	 * <p><b>Note that this method is not currently used by the framework.</b>
	 * Typical Advisor implementations always return {@code true}.
	 * Use singleton/prototype bean definitions or appropriate programmatic
	 * proxy creation to ensure that Advisors have the correct lifecycle model.
	 * @return whether this advice is associated with a particular target instance
	 */
	boolean isPerInstance();
